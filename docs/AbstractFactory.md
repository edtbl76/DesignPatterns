# Abstract Factory 

## Definition
- provides an interface for creating families/trees of related/dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

## Discussion
The Abstract Factory pattern is commonly referred to as a "Factory of Factories"
used to provide an additional layer of abstraction above the Factory Method 
pattern.  

Provides a way to collect and encapsulate similar individual factories.
- the creation of objects is delegated to the factory object

Similar to the "Simple Factory" method:
- Simple Factory creates a group of related objects
- Abstract Factory returns factories that create groups of related objects
