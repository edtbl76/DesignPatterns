Creational Patterns are patterns that solve problems associated with

- reducing complexity
- reducing boilerplate
- increasing flexibility/extensibility

"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the "Gang of Four"
(Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides)


# Structural Patterns
These patterns leverage similarities between objects and/or their relationships to
