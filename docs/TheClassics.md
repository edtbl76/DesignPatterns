# The Classics
By the classics, I'm referring to the patterns introduced in the 1994 book
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the "Gang of Four"
(Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides)

## Creational Patterns
Creational Patterns are patterns that solve problems associated with
creating objects directly. 
- reducing complexity
- reducing boilerplate
- increasing flexibility/extensibility
